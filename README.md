# 💼 Job Board Backend

Backend API for a job board platform built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Socket.IO**.  
It provides REST APIs and real-time job updates using WebSockets.

---

## 🚀 Features

- JWT-based user authentication
- CRUD operations for job listings
- Apply to jobs
- Real-time updates using Socket.IO
- Rate limiting for API protection
- AI-powered job recommendations (OpenAI API)

---

## 📌 What’s Working?

- User auth (register/login)  
- Create & view jobs  
- Apply for jobs  
- Real-time job notifications  
- **AI job recommendations (implemented, but inactive due to OpenAI API credit limits)**

---

## 🚧 What’s Missing?

- Admin roles & panel  
- Resume uploads  
- Tests  
- Deployment  

---

## ⏳ If I Had More Time...

- Add role-based access control  
- Enable file uploads for resumes  
- Write unit/integration tests  
- Deploy to Render or Fly.io  
- Reactivate the AI recommendation system with valid OpenAI credits  

---

## 🧪 Notes

- The AI job recommendation feature is fully integrated using OpenAI's API.  
  However, due to lack of API credits, it currently fails to fetch results.  
  The endpoint and logic are in place and will work once a valid API key with credits is available.
