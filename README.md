# 💼 Job Board Backend

Backend API for a job board platform built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Socket.IO**.  
It provides RESTful APIs to handle job listings, applications, authentication, and real-time updates.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **JWT Authentication** for secure user access
- **Job Listings** with full CRUD operations
- **Job Applications** via API
- **Real-time Job Notifications** using WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- **Rate Limiting** for API security
- **AI-Powered Job Recommendations** using OpenAI (logic implemented)

---

## 📌 What’s Working?

- User registration and login functionality
- APIs for creating, viewing, and applying to jobs
- Real-time job broadcast to all connected clients
- AI recommendation endpoint (currently inactive due to API credit limits)

---

## 🚧 What’s Missing?

- Admin panel and role-based access
- Resume file upload capability
- Automated tests (unit/integration)
- Full production-level deployment automation

---

## ⏳ If I Had More Time...

- Implement user roles (Admin, Company, Job Seeker)
- Add resume upload support for job seekers
- Write tests using Jest or a similar framework
- Fully optimize and deploy to Render with CI/CD
- Activate and test AI recommendations with OpenAI credits

---

## 🧪 Notes

The AI recommendation system is fully built and integrated via OpenAI API.  
However, due to lack of API credits, it currently doesn't return live suggestions.  
Once credits are added, the endpoint will be fully functional.
